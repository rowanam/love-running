Things I would like to add or change about this project in future:

*Different heights of club ethos sections, putting the lower two out of alignment with each other
Ideas for fixing this: use a minimum-height property

*Social media icons link overflow - the a elements are wider than the icons themselves, meanign to the left and right
you can click on the link without your mouse being over the icon
Not sure how to fix this

*Get rid of the excess white space under the circular photo when calling the first media query, for tablet sizes

*Fix the footer on mobile screen sizes (currently too high up)

*Fix the circular photo on mobile screen sizes - slightly too wide, falls off the edge of the screen
